The components reference is a collection of all the components that Ion provides. If you like Ion but want to change a specific component, you can use the source code here to create your own custom component. These docs are generated from the source code, so they are always up-to-date. 

If you don't know how to override components, check out [Starlight's guide on overriding components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/).
