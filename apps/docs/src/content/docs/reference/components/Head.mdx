title: "Head"

The `Head` component is used to render the `<head>` element of the document. It is used to set the title, meta tags, and other elements in the `<head>` of the document. Ion's override is pretty much identical to the default Starlight `Head` component, the only difference being that it adds it's own generator tag.

import headComponent from 'starlight-ion-theme/components/Head.astro?raw'
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Code code={headComponent} lang="astro" title="Head.astro" />
